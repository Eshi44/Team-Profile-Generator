# Team Profile Generator ğŸ“Š CLI App using Inquirer and TDD with Jest

The application is designed to build a software engineering team generated through a node.js command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team and their information such as name, id, position, github, and email. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers, managers and interns. This app was designed with Test Driven Development in mind. 

When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file in the output folder that displays the formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
